title: Match
---
A `Match` object describes a single match scheduled between two teams. A `Match` object with `MatchTeam` objects but without `MatchPlayer` objects can be used to describe a match that has been scheduled but not played. Matches are contained in `Round` objects, which are contained in `Phase` objects of the `Tournament`.

If a `Match` includes `Lineup` objects on its `MatchTeam` objects and includes `MatchQuestion` objects, a complete scoresheet can be reconstructed.

For more complicated overtime scenarios (e.g. involving nonstandard <code><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/answer_type">AnswerType</a></code>s), you will need to create different <code>AnswerType</code>s with different values of <code>awards_bonus</code>.</td>

The `segment_break` option represents a moment between portions of a match such as the end of the first quarter in a four-quarter format. `halftime` can be thought of as equivalent to `segment_break` for the common case of match formats whose regulation segments are simply two halves. `before_overtime` can be thought of as a special case of `segment_break`.</td>

## MatchQuestionBonus object

<table class="fields"><tbody>

    <td class="type">Number</td>
    <td>Which bonus number this was. May or may not match the `question_number` of the `MatchQuestion` parent, depending on whether bonuses are paired with tossups or simply read in order (and if the latter, on whether any bonus-earning questions failed to lead to a bonus).</td>

For bonuses that do not have distinguishable parts &mdash; e.g. "Name any <i>m</i> of the <i>n</i> things that&hellip;" or 30&ndash;20&ndash;10-style bonuses, treat the entire bonus as a single `MatchQuestionBonusPart`.

    <th class="type">Number</td>
    <td>Number of points earned by the non-controlling team. May be omitted if bonuses do not bounce back, but should not be omitted merely because the non-controlling team earned no points. In all formats with which we are familiar, this must be a nonnegative integer, and can only be positive if `controlled_points` is `0`.</td>
