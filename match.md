title: Match
---
A `Match` object describes a single match scheduled between two teams. A `Match` object with `MatchTeam` objects but without `MatchPlayer` objects can be used to describe a match that has been scheduled but not played. Matches are contained in `Round` objects, which are contained in `Phase` objects of the `Tournament`.

If a `Match` includes `Lineup` objects on its `MatchTeam` objects and includes `MatchQuestion` objects, a complete scoresheet can be reconstructed.

For more complicated overtime scenarios (e.g. involving nonstandard <code><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/answer_type">AnswerType</a></code>s), you will need to create different <code>AnswerType</code>s with different values of <code>awards_bonus</code>.</td>
